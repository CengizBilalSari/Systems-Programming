# Systems-Programming
This repository contains the projects and related materials for the CMPE 230 Systems Programming course.

## **Project 1: Language Interpreter and Storage Management with C**
This assignment involves developing a systems programming project in C that processes user inputs from the standard input and displays the results to the standard output. The primary goal is to interpret inputs written in a specific language and perform operations on various entities based on these inputs. Users may provide their sentences in a combined manner, and the code must determine whether the given sentences conform to the specified language.
## **Project 2: Postfix Translator with GNU Assembly**
This project involves implementing a GNU assembly language program that interprets a single line of postfix expression involving decimal quantities and outputs the equivalent RISC-V 32-bit machine language instructions. The objective is to understand the conversion of high-level operations into machine code using the RISC-V architecture.
## **Project 3: MineSweeper Game**
This project involves implementing the classic Minesweeper game. The objective is to reveal all cells without triggering mines. The game displays numbers on revealed cells to indicate the number of adjacent mines, and empty cells trigger the reveal of neighboring cells recursively. The game includes features such as flagging mines, restarting the game, and providing hints.Hints are not random; they are generated in a way that a player could logically find them.
