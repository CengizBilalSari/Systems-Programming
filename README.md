## **Project 1: [Language Interpreter and Storage Management]**
This assignment involves developing a systems programming project in C that processes user inputs from the standard input and displays the results to the standard output. The primary goal is to interpret inputs written in a specific language and perform operations on various entities based on these inputs. Users may provide their sentences in a combined manner, and the code must determine whether the given sentences conform to the specified language.
